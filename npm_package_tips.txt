### How to setup VSTS feed

- Generate npm credentials
- Copy the whole text to C:\Users\ghorvath\.npmrc
- Open $(ProjectDir)\.npmrc (create if not exist)
- Add the registry part:
	```
	registry=https://geomant.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/Packages/npm/registry/
	always-auth=true
	```
- Now with `npm publish` the package will be published and `npm install` can be used

### How to locally test package

- Navigete to the package directory
- Run `npm run build`
- Run `npm link`. 
	This will link the package to npm dependencies. 
	Basically it means we will be able to use it in other project but only on our computer.
- Navigate to the wrapper project
- Run `npm link <package-name>`
